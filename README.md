This repo contains project and solution files for building zlib library for Windows using Visual Studio.

The solution is able to build both static and dynamic libraries in debug and release configurations for x86 and x64 architectures

The actual zlib sources are included as a git submodule pointed to https://github.com/madler/zlib

Tested versions: 1.3, 1.2.13

## How to build?
    # clone the repo
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/apotocki/zlib-win
    
    #open and build solution zlib.sln
    
    # have fun
